# CD-A-analysis
Professor Greg has created a dataset that contains 14,000+ observations of the compensation discussion within SEC filings. My research steps are as follows:

(1) understand the management compensation literature (including the types of studies that have been done and the 'gaps' in the literature)
 
(2) develop concrete textual analysis skills using R
 
(3) undertake a preliminary analysis of the compensation data set
 
(4) learn how to download and merge financial data for the companies in the compensation data set (Fall 2021)

In this repository, I have uploaded my summary of past studies I have found. Moreover, the script of merging codes are also uploaded.
